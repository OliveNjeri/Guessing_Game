    -In Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable a value, the value won’t change.
    -To make a variable mutable, we add mut before the variable name
    -a crate is a collection of Rust source code files
    -The rand crate is a library crate, which contains code that is intended to be used in other programs and can’t be executed on its own.
